# Detroit Blight Violation Compliance Predictor

## Background

To help upkeep its apperance, the city of Detroit issues issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Collections are resource intensive. The goal of this model is to improve the city's fine compliance by identifying which violation parameters best indicate whether the blight recipients are most likely to be compliant.

## Objective / Project Scope

I initially completed this project for University of Michigan's Applied Maching Learning course on Coursera. In the coming weeks, I will expand upon my initial work by increasing the dataset, elaborating upon the inference, and designing fine collection strategies.

The gradient boosted classifier that is programmed in classifier_model.py achieved a 0.8005 AUC. XGBoost is incompatible with Coursera's Jupyter Notebook interface. As a benchmark, an AUC score of 0.75 was required for full credit.
